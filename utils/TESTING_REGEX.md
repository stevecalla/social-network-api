#### SUBMISSION
Hello - I'm happy to provide my submission for Project #18 Social Network API. See the links below, please. All videos below are less than 2 minutes.

- [ ] GitHub Repo: https://github.com/stevecalla/social-network-api
- [ ] Video #1: Start/Sync & Tech Criteria https://youtu.be/HNc61D-j4nI
- [ ] Video #2: User Routes https://youtu.be/rqdCeiGhVAI
- [ ] Video #3: Friend Routes https://youtu.be/rPL0nG73ECg
- [ ] Video #4: Thought Routes https://youtu.be/5udd7YO4f24
- [ ] Video #5: Reaction Routes https://youtu.be/qBMw2xhaNkU

To start/sync the server please use "npm start", "node index.js" or "nodemon" (if you have it installed globally). 

A seed is available by running "npm run seed".

The readme includes a thorough review of all API routes and features. The features include:

1. Email validation using "match" schema function
2. "Virtual" friends and reactions count
3. "Getter" method to format the time stamp using the native JavaScript `Date` object to format timestamps (`new Intl.DateTimeFormat('en-US', options).format(date)`). See `utils/helpers.js`
4. Sub/nest-document for the "reactionsSchema"
5. Self-reference join for the friends list/array
6. "Populate" (join) for the thoughts and friends list/array
7. **BONUS** "addReactions" controller ensures a reaction doesn't exist prior to insertion
8. **BONUS** "createThought" controller adds the thought._id to the user's associated thoughts array
9. **BONUS** "deleteThought" controller deletes the thought._id from the user's associated thoughts array
10. **BONUS** Robust seed code for all data

Thank you, Steve

## FEEDBACK
```
Amazing work on your Social Network API. I can see that you have an extremely detailed README, which includes screenshots, a hefty description, your video link, etc. I love your extremely descriptive README! I would recommend mending the videos (using a video editing software) together instead of submitting numerous videos. 

I can see that you have your videos showcasing the various endpoints including from users to reactions! However, I would advise to add some commentary into your walkthrough to provide some of your thoughts. With that being said, amazing work! - KN
